## Package name: ID_distributions

The package consists of two classes of data distributions (Gaussian and Binomial) inheriting from the General distribution class.

It consists of 3 Modules:
Generaldistribution, Gaussiandistribution and Binomialdistribution

The Gaussian ditribution outputs the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, plots a histogram of the data and gives the output of adding two guassian distributions

The Binomial distrbution outputs the mean, standard deviation, p (probability of positive outcomes) and n (number of samples).
